## About

We build an interactive visualisation exploring global carbon footprint inequality by country and decile for the period 1990-2019. The data is taken from the [World Inequality Database](https://wid.world//) (WID).

[Click here to go to the graphs](html/fig_1990.html){: .button}

You can also download the data here in <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tzvetanmoev/core-skyscraper-3-carbon/master/wid_car_footprint_usd19_wide.xls" download ="download"> xlsx </a> or <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tzvetanmoev/core-skyscraper-3-carbon/master/wid_car_footprint_usd19_wide.csv" download ="download"> csv </a> formats.
 
Below you can see the distribution of carbon footprints both within and between countries in 2019. Carbon footprint refers to the tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions per capita in an income decile. Taller blocks correspond to higher carbon footprints.  Countries with larger populations are assigned wider blocks. Colours correspond to how rich the country was in 1990, with poorer countries shaded red and richer countries shaded green. Countries are ordered according to national income per capita in each year, while holding colours fixed from the 1990 income per capita ordering. Therefore with these figures we can see inequality within and across countries over time as well as changes in per capita income. You can click on the picture to explore the graph in greater depth.

These visualisations were created for [The CORE Project](http://www.core-econ.org/). CORE is an open-access, interactive ebook-based course for anyone interested in learning about the economy and economics.

For more information on how the data on carbon inequality was collected, please refer to the insightful papers by Prof Lucas Chancel who created the database ([Chancel, 2021](https://wid.world/news-article/climate-change-the-global-inequality-of-carbon-emissions/); [Chancel, 2022](https://wid.world/document/global-carbon-inequality-1990-2019-wid-world-working-paper-2021-22/))
